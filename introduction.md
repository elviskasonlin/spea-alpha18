This project, done by Selwyn, Glen, P. Elvis, and Sheng Yang, concluded on the 13th of February 2019 which is a 6 weeks project,  working on a underwater submersible remotely operated surveillance vehicle prototype.

The team was tasked with engineering a solution revolving around water. During this 6 weeks worth of time, the team came up with prototype to test on shape for buoyancy and streamlining purposes. The team came up with building an underwater submersible remotely operated vehicle (ROV) alongside with installing it with a camera to be able to see underwater.

The purpose of building the ROV was for underwater security. Since many drones have been implemented up in the skies with camera, our team was like "We should do one for underwater plus it is also related to the theme of the project".

The camera is streaming live video so that we are able to see underwater in real-time as staying secure is always best if we know our surrounding so that we are able to act as quickly as possible.
