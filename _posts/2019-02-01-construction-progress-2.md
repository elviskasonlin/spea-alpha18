#Update
We did quite a few things over the next few days.

#Electrical
We have laser cutted a board to have our microcontroller and motor shield boards to back face each other so that our set up inside the box would look neater as there were lots of wire being connected internally which ended taking quite abit of space which leaves us to have an even smaller space to put the boards in.

 Some of the lesson we learnt was to tag our cables by using masking tape as majority of our wires are the same color. Also, we should not cut our cable to a very short length before ensuring that there is enough room to be connected to the  board or else we had a very hard time to connect it.

#Mechanical
Mounted and adapters were 3D printed, to be the link between our parts and the submersible ROV. Wings and the weights adapter all being 3D printed as having the weight adapter is to ensure some room to play with the buoyancy of our boat. As depending which sides the boat tilts, we are able to add counterweights to it to balance it off. We used epoxy to try and seal up the contact between  the contacts  lock and lock box and the PVC pipe.
