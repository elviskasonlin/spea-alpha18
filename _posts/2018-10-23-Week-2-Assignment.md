# Assignment One : Digital I/O

1. ATMega328 has six 10-bit 5V ADC ports.
  *  Which ports are used? <br /> 
  * What is the command used to read the ADC <br />
  * What is the solution?
  * how is voltage accuracy achieved?
  * How fast are the ADC ports?
  * I need a better ADC, what can I do?
  * How fast does the ADC need to be?
2. Experimentations with digital I/O
  * Here's a link to a separate blog post on the experiments [LINK]({{ site.baseurl  }}{% post_url 2018-10-24-digital-io-experiments %})
