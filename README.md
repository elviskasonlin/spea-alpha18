In order to run this on a local server, the following three things are required..

1. Ruby
2. Jekyll
3. Bundle

After installing ruby through apt-get, homebrew or via any package manager, install the required dependencies by executing :
```
gem install jekyll bundler
```.

Once all the packages are installed, change your current directory to this project directory and type in the following command :
```
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

Once the server is running, go to localhost:4000/project/ and check it out!
